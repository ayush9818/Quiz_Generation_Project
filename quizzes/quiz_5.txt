Question 1:Consider a large language model that has been trained on a corpus of news articles, scientific papers, and novels. Given a new input sequence, the model predicts the next word in the sequence based on the context of the previous words. However, the model sometimes generates nonsensical or incorrect words. This phenomenon is known as ____________.
Choice1:Overfitting
Choice2:Underfitting
Choice3:Regularization
Choice4:Autoregression
Answer:Autoregression
Explanation:Autoregression is a type of language model where the model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the context of the previous words. However, it is prone to generating nonsensical or incorrect words due to the absence of a mechanism to prevent such errors, unlike Overfitting and Underfitting which are issues related to model complexity and data fit, and Regularization which is a technique used to prevent overfitting.

Question 2:Consider a large language model that has been fine-tuned on a corpus of customer reviews for a popular e-commerce platform.
