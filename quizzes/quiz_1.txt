Question 3:A company sources raw materials from two different suppliers. Supplier A charges a fixed cost of $100 per unit and a variable cost of $50 per unit. Supplier B charges a fixed cost of $80 per unit and a variable cost of $30 per unit. The company purchases 100 units from each supplier. Which supplier offers a lower total cost per unit?
Choice1:Supplier A
Choice2:Supplier B
Choice3:Both suppliers offer the same total cost per unit
Choice4:It is impossible to determine the total cost per unit based on the given information
Answer:Choice2: Supplier B
Explanation:To find the total cost per unit for each supplier, we need to calculate the fixed cost and variable cost for 100 units for each supplier. For Supplier A, the total cost would be $100 (fixed cost) + ($50 * 100) (variable cost) = $6500 + $5000 = $11,500. For Supplier B, the total cost would be $80 (fixed cost) + ($30 * 100) (variable cost) = $80 + $3,000 = $3,080. Therefore, Supplier B offers a lower total cost per unit ($3,080) compared to Supplier A ($11,500).

Question 4:A company has two suppliers for a raw material. Supplier A charges a fixed cost of $50 per unit and a variable cost of $10 per unit. Supplier B charges a fixed cost of $80 per unit and a variable cost of $5 per unit. The company purchases 200 units from each supplier. Which supplier offers a lower total cost per unit?
Choice1:Supplier A, with a total cost of $11,000
Choice2:Supplier B, with a total cost of $10,500
Choice3:Both suppliers offer the same total cost per unit, which is $10,500
Choice4:It is impossible to determine the total cost per unit based on the given information
Answer:Choice2: Supplier B
Explanation:To find the total cost per unit for each supplier, we need to calculate the fixed cost and variable cost for 200 units for each supplier. For Supplier A, the total cost would be $50 (fixed cost) + ($10 * 200) (variable cost) = $50 + $2,000 = $2,050 per unit. For Supplier B, the total cost would be $80 (fixed cost) + ($5 * 200) (variable cost) = $80 + $1,000 = $1,880 per unit. Therefore, Supplier B offers a lower total cost per unit ($1,880) compared to Supplier A ($2,050).
